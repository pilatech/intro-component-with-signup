## Overview

Intro component with sign up form and client side validation with JavaScript

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process 
 - I created the markup using the desktop layout at the same time being aware of all the other layouts
 - Created styles using the mobile first approach
 - I included all the error styles too
 - Finally wrote JavaScript for interactivity. To minimize JavaScript and inline styles, I only used it to add/remove classes - the styling being handled by CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
